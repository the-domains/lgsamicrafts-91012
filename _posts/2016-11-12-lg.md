# With a spirit for fashion since I was one year old and fell in love with this dress...

### _Every time they tried to cheat me with another dress, I tried to be grisly_

## Then, I only needed to pray for new shoes...

## Why? What went wrong?

### _I checked the family history and what I found maybe was a curse because of my grandmother. What shoes she was wearing on her wedding day was unforgivable. Everybody was speechless, grandfather including._

### Still no sign of new shoes for me!

### _My parents told me in the end to accept the reality and the fact that my two older sisters worn them befor me._

### _Accepted...if you promise not to dress me like them!_

## **...That´s what happens when the time become your master...**

### _You will look like my sisters and cousin...modern..cool..in... why none one of them wants to show her face today_

## From an early age they started to dress us like clowns. This time I couldn´t be grisly.

### _I realized, there is something that needs to be done!_
