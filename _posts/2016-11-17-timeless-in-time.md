# Timeless in TiiMe

> The Infinity of Creativity is fascinating. All Creativity is coming from Infinity.

### **Inspiration **is present all around us. I´m grateful for every touch of it, everything that comes. It feels like it´s coming from nowhere. It´s exciting and surprising because you never know when and what around us will motivate you**next tiiMe** to create something...

# **The Entry into Mystery**

### **Can you imagine...** that this incredible sweet bird could be an inspiration to make this bracelet ?

## **...he is just irreplaceable...**

# **You don´t have to adapt your taste to the tradition. The tradition will adapt to your taste**

## _...Jewelry connected with many hundred years old tradition..._

### Thrilled to make both, the traditional or classic, as well as modern styles. Near showing this handicraft in a different dimension, where it will be given more focus on own designs, that´s what I am looking for.

> To give other artists inspiration or ideas to create, I´m honored.

### I love to find unique pieces and components handcrafted by other artisans, connect them to my and let them highlight some of my own crafts.

# **...Copying others design...**

### **To copy **something means don´t recognize the line between inspered and copied, which**automatically excludes creativity.**

### To see it as a challenge instead works best for Mii. Like it makes me stay constantly creative, which I love.
